## Description
The HEAP Hotel project is designed to demonstrate a simple C programming project. It serves as a foundation for exploring the capabilities of the C language and its applications in various domains. It specificially highlights using the heap and freeing memory after its usage:

Definition:
```quote
In C programming, the Heap (not an acronym, just a name for a "pile" of memory) is a region of your computer's RAM used for dynamic memory allocation.

Unlike the Stack, which handles local variables automatically, the Heap is a "free-for-all" area where you, the programmer, manually request and release memory during the execution of a program.
```
